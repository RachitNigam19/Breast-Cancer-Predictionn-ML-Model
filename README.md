Project Overview
Breast cancer diagnosis is crucial for early detection and treatment. This project applies machine learning to classify breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant. By using this model, users can input specific characteristics about the tumor, and the model will predict the likelihood of the tumor's nature, helping inform potential next steps.

Dataset
The model is trained on a well-established breast cancer dataset, which includes key features like:

Mean radius
Mean texture
Mean perimeter
Mean area
Mean smoothness
And other relevant features
These features are used as predictors for the target variable, which indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

Model
This project uses a [specify model(s) like logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest] to classify the input data. The model has been trained and tested to achieve high accuracy, balancing sensitivity and specificity for reliable predictions.

Dependencies
To run the model, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
also if dont wanna run on local machine
